## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add `Toast` as a dependency in your `Package.swift` file:

```swift
let package = Package(
    dependencies: [
        .Package(url: "https://github.com/brabanod/Toast", from: "1.0.0")
    ]
)
```



## Usage

To show a toast in your `UIViewController`, simply use

```swift
import Toast

Toast()
    .text("Carl's AirPods", subtitle: "Connected")
    .show(in: self)
```

The toast is then displayed and automatically vanishes after 2 seconds. You can also hide the toast manually by calling

```swift
toast.hide()
```

### Options

This package offers various options to customize you toast.

#### Font

You can change the font for both (title and subtitle) labels or for each label individually.

```swift
toast
    .font(UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 8.0))
    
toast
    .font(
        titleLabel: largeFont,
        subtitleLabel: smallFont)
```

#### Text Color

You can change the text color for both (title and subtitle) labels or for each label individually.
```swift
toast
    .textColor(.blue)
    
toast
    .textColor(
        titleLabel: .red,
        subtitleLabel: .orange)
```

#### Background Color

You can change the toast's background color.
```swift

    .color(.lightGray)
```

#### Duration

You can change the duration, how long the toast is shown before it is automatically hidden.
```swift

    .duration(4.2)
```

#### Layout

You can change the layout of the toast. Either both title and subtitle label are displayed, or only the title label is displayed.

    toast

```

#### Accessory View

The toast can have an additional view or image left to the toast message. This accessory is sized 26x26 pixels. The accessory view may contain a custom animation.

```swift
toast
    .image(UIImage(systemName: "bell")!)
    
toast
    .accessoryView(myCustomView)
```

#### Handlers

Toast has 4 handler, that may be assigned, which get called on specific actions:
* Start of the show animation
* Completion of the show animation
* Start of the hide animation
* Completion of the hide animation

```swift
toast
    .addHandler(startHide: {
        print("Starting SHOW ...")
    })
    .addHandler(showCompletion: {
        print("Finished SHOW.")
    })
    .addHandler(startHide: {
        print("Starting HIDE ...")
    })
    .addHandler(hideCompletion: {
        print("Finished HIDE.")
    })
```
